Sentiment Analysis Project
Overview
This project involves building a sentiment analysis system to classify the sentiment of text data as positive, negative, or neutral. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to analyze and interpret the sentiment expressed in user input or a dataset of text.

Features
Preprocessing text data (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.).
Training and testing a sentiment analysis model.
Predicting sentiment for custom user input.
Visualizing results using graphs or metrics.
Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries/Frameworks:
scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
NLTK or spaCy: For text preprocessing and NLP tasks.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib or Seaborn: For visualizations.
Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing labeled text data for sentiment (e.g., IMDb movie reviews, Twitter sentiment analysis dataset, or custom datasets).
Example Dataset Format:
Text	Sentiment
"I love this product!"	Positive
"The service was terrible."	Negative
"Itâ€™s okay, not great."	Neutral
Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis.git  
cd sentiment-analysis  
Set up a virtual environment (optional):

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac  
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows  
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt  
Download NLP resources (if applicable):

python
Copy
Edit
import nltk  
nltk.download('stopwords')  
nltk.download('punkt')  
Usage
Preprocess the Data:

Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the dataset for training.
Train the Model:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train.py  
This script trains the sentiment analysis model and saves it for future use.

Test the Model:

bash
Copy
Edit
python test.py  
Evaluate the model's performance on a test dataset.

Predict Sentiment for Custom Input:

bash
Copy
Edit
python predict.py  
Input text, and the model will classify the sentiment.

Results
